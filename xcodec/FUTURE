Possibly-bad future ideas:

(o) Incorporate run-length encoding.
(o) Make definitions and references actually insert data, not just add to the
    backref table.
(o) Make a uuid or similar part of the hash name so that collisions caused by
    restart don't confuse remote side.
(o) Add a 'generation' field to the hash as sent on wire and handle collisions
    that way?  Then first form of hash is fastest, followed by second, etc., as
    they are search -- can also put their data in a map.
(o) Possibly use two hash functions -- even just mixing crc in with the Adler
    stuff might help increase our hash entropy?  Been a while since I really
    read up on the subject and would do well to do so again.  Currently the
    entropy is not great.
