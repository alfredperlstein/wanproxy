o) Don't let a peer claim to have our UUID?
o) Permanent storage.
o) Decide whether to keep a std::set (or something fancier) of hashes associated
   with each UUID (i.e. ones we have sent to them).  We could even make it a
   set of <UUID,UUID,hash> so that we can distribute updates like routing
   tables.
o) Do lookups in the peer's dictionary and ours at the same time.
o) Put a generation number in the hashes so that if the remote side recycles a
   hash, we can do something about it.
