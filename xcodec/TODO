o) Don't let a peer claim to have our UUID?
o) Permanent storage.
o) Decide whether to do lookup based on what data the UUID has claimed to have.
o) Decide whether to keep a std::set (or something fancier) of hashes associated
   with each UUID (i.e. ones we have sent to them).  We could even make it a
   set of <UUID,UUID,hash> so that we can distribute updates like routing
   tables.
