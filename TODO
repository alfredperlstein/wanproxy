o) Make the XCodec encoder and decoder asynchronous.
o) Connetion table. Database.
o) Add an IO queueing system that will make it possible to use lio_listio on
   systems that support it.
o) Make it possible to detect when we are sending to a socket that is also
   within WANProxy and avoid a system call -- just copy directly to the
   appropriate buffer.  It should be pretty easy to do this with the IO queueing
   system if we getpeername/getsockname to identify this occurring.
o) The ProxyPipe code uses an asynchronous callback to notify the ProxyClient
   of an error, but this could result delayed cancellation of a write to a
   channel which has given us an error.  As a result, we may get a SIGPIPE.
   There has to be a good way to solve this.
o) HTTP termination and reinitiation good enough to support an HTTP proxy mode.
o) Fix bugs.
o) Secondary storage using tcache.
o) In-path forwarding using BPF and a tiny network stack.
o) Experiment with new codecs.  Current ideas involve using collision-prone
   hashes and variable-length tree encodings.  Others will present themselves,
   no doubt.
o) Better API for handling network addresses.
o) Many compression algorithms.
o) Chain codecs, etc.
