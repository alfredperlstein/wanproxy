o) New (ideally modular) proxy/halfproxy configuration and code.  The current
   proxying code is a mess.
o) HTTP termination and reinitiation good enough to support an HTTP proxy mode.
o) Fix bugs.
o) Secondary storage using tcache.
o) In-path forwarding using BPF and a tiny network stack.
o) Experiment with new codecs.  Current ideas involve using collision-prone
   hashes and variable-length tree encodings.  Others will present themselves,
   no doubt.
