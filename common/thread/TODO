Threads need to pick a blocking mechanism and somehow stick to it reliably, so there can be a neat and tidy Thread::kill function.  A signal should knock a thread out of anything, but that can still have races.  It would be nice if Thread::kill didn't have to be virtual, and if it could be worked into a generalized thread-to-thread messaging paradigm, but that's problematic when one of the major purposes of having threads in the first place is to be able to use other polling mechanisms in separate threads, i.e. blocking for libpcap or X11 or whatever.
