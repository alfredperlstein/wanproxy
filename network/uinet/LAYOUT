uinet directory layout:

Directory	Description
=============	=============================================================
lib		Libraries that are or use the user-space networking stack.
lib/libuinet	Library containing the user-space port of the FreeBSD TCP/IP
		stack and additional management and configuration interfaces.
		Many kernel interfaces (or portions thereof) had to be
		reimplemented for the port.  Kernel functionality implemented
		in <kern_file>.c in the kernel source tree can generally be
		found in uinet_<kern_file>.c in this directory. 
lib/libuinet/include
		Public and private includes for the libuinet port and header
		overrides for some of the FreeBSD kernel headers.
mk		Port of requisite FreeBSD kernel make infrastructure to gmake.
sys		Subset of the FreeBSD kernel source tree required by this port
		of the TCP/IP stack.  Subdirs have been imported in their
		entirety from the FreeBSD sources, even if not all the sources
		therein will be used, in order to make merging with newer
		kernel code more straightforward.
sys/machine	Contains machine-specific sources and includes from the FreeBSD
		kernel, with a synthetic structure explained below.
sys/machine/<arch>/<arch>
		Copy of sys/<arch>/<arch> from the FreeBSD kernel source tree.
		Only the machine-specific IP checksum routines are of use to
		this port.
sys/machine/<arch>/machine
		Copy of sys/<arch>/include from the FreeBSD kernel source tree,
		so placed to allow a single-stage build using the include path
		-Isys/machine/<arch> to access machine/ include	files, instead
		of copying them to the build dir first.
/sys/machine/x86/x86
		Copy of sys/x86/include from the FreeBSD kernel source tree,
		so placed to allow a single-stage build using the include path
		-Isys/machine/x86 to access x86/ include files, instead of
		copying them to the build dir first.
