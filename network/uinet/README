UINET (User INET)
=============================================================================

This is a user-space port of the FreeBSD TCP/IP stack, begun with the
FreeBSD 9.1-RELEASE sources and many pieces of Kip Macy's user-space
port of an earlier version of the FreeBSD stack, libplebnet.


The current build target is a test program for exercising the stack
that does a netmap takeover of the interface in the host system
specified in the environment variable UINETIF, uses the same IP
configuration that the host interface had, and runs a simple TCP
loopback server on port 2222 on that interface.


cd wanproxy/network/uinet/lib/libuinet
gmake TOPDIR=../../../..
export UINETIF=em1
./uinet_test

netcat or similar can then be used to make connections to the loopback
server and drive traffic.
