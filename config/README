The general-purpose configuration system.  It consists of three sorts of things.
The first are types -- these are basic scalar types like network addresses,
strings, pointers, etc.  The second are classes -- these are structured types
which contain one or more named, typed fields.  The third are objects, which are
instances of classes.  Objects may be created, their member parameters may be
set and they can be activated/deactivated.

There is a single, global namespace for objects.

When an object is created, its members are all initialized to sane or
obviously-bogus defaults.  When an object is activated, any actions associated
with its activation (e.g. listening on a port) are taken only after it is
determined that any fields which must be initialized have been initialized.

When an object is deactivated, any reversible actions associated with it (e.g.
listening on a port) must be stopped or reversed if at all possible.  The order
in which objects are deactivated is the reverse of the order in which they are
activated.  Deactivation may occur at any time, e.g. as a result of SIGINT, but
will not occur while a callback is activating and will always occur from within
the main event loop.
