Everything has been sort-of hacked together to get something working.  Lots to
do to make it not awful.
o) Make the send and receive processes more asynchronous.  Really want to be
   able to not have to do long, synchronous encryption operations, etc.
o) Make the Crypto* stuff less awful.  It seems like the Method abstraction is
   perhaps not worth it.
o) Do separate algorithm from instance in the SSH code.  It's a mess right now,
   what with the clone() methods.  Yuck.
o) Make sure all those things created by new have appropriate deletes somewhere.
o) Likewise, go over all the BIGNUM, etc., stuff and add frees.
o) Maybe don't ever generate random padding, but ought to be able to generate
   random cookies for the key exchange.
o) Have the AlgorithmNegotiation code add all algorithms to itself somehow.  We
   only really want the caller to have to provide a key.
o) Some kind of server public key verification callback.
