Directory	Description
=============	=============================================================
alg		Portable implementations of simple, standard algorithms.
		Organized into sub-directories based on type.
alg/hash	Hash algorithms.
common		Non-specific functionality that is of general interest, e.g.
		the logging system, test infrastructure and Buffer class.
common/thread	Threading infrastructure.
common/timer	Time sampling infrastructure.
common/uuid	UUID API.
config		General-purpose configuration system infrastructure and some
		essential types and classes.
event		The event system and infrastructure to support it, such as
